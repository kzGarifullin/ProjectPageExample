## Updates

- [27/02/2025] 🎉🎉🎉 MaterialFusion has been accepted by CVPR 2025.
- [09/02/2025] 🔥🔥🔥 MaterialFusion release.

## Prerequisites

To run our method, please ensure you meet the following hardware and software requirements:
- Operating System: Linux
- GPU: NVIDIA V100 with 40GB RAM
- Python Version: 3.8.5
- PyTorch Version: 2.0.1
- Diffusers Version: 0.29.1

## Setup

* Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ControlGenAI/MaterialFusion.git
cd MaterialFusion
```

* Download IP-Adapter:
```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter
```

* Setup the environment. Conda environment `material_fusion` will be created and you can use it.
```bash
conda env create -f material_fusion_env.yaml
```

## Inference

You can use the `main.py` script to perform inference with the model. This allows you to generate visual outputs based on the provided prompts and parameters.

### Parameters 

- `init_prompt`: A text description of the content in the original image (e.g. "A photo of a car").
- `edit_prompt`: A text description of what you expect in the output image (e.g. "A photo of a golden car"). It is possible to use  $y_{src}$  instead of  $y_{trg}$ . Material transfer is successful regardless of whether the target prompt is present or not(i.e. when  $y_{trg}=y_{src}$ ). However, the presence of the target prompt facilitates easier material transfer.
- `transfer_force`: The strength of the transfer effects applied, specified as a space-separated list of floats (e.g., "0.1 0.5 0.8 1.0").
- `obj_name`: The name of the object, which is used for naming the output images (e.g. "car").
- `obj_path`: The file path to the image of the object (e.g. `./example_images/objects/car.png`).
- `material_image_path`: The path to the material image(e.g. `./example_images/materials/4.jpg`).
- `config_path`: The path to the configuration file used for the model (e.g. `./configs/materialfusion_colab.yaml`). For transferring in Colab, the colab configuration works well; however, if your hardware allows, it's better to use the 'best' configuration. 

### Here’s an example of how to perform inference:
```
init_prompt="A photo of a car"                            
edit_prompt="A photo of a car"                            
transfer_force="0.1 0.5 0.8 1.0"                          
obj_name="car"                                            
obj_path="./example_images/objects/car.png"              
material_image_path="./example_images/materials/4.jpg"   
config_path='./configs/materialfusion_colab.yaml' 

python main.py --init_prompt "$init_prompt" \
--edit_prompt "$edit_prompt" \
--transfer_force "$transfer_force" \
--obj_name "$obj_name" \
--obj_path "$obj_path" \
--material_image_path "$material_image_path" \
--config "$config_path"
```

## Quickstart

We provide examples of applying our pipeline to real image editing in the [notebook](example_notebooks/material_transfer.ipynb).

The overall pipeline of MaterialFusion for material transfer. Starting with DDIM inversion of the target image $x_{init}$ and material exemplar $y_{im}$, the framework combines the IP-Adapter with UNet and employs a guider energy function for precise material transfer. A dual-masking strategy ensures material application only on target regions while preserving background consistency, ultimately generating the edited output $x_{edit}$. The parameter $\lambda$, known as the Material Transfer Force, controls the intensity of the material application, enabling adjustment of the transfer effect according to user preference.
